# React weather app

### This app was a coding challange for myself.
I wanted to challange myself in react, to learn more. Therefore I set myself the challange to make a weather app in react within the time span of a weekend. Because I only used about 15 hours on this project the code is messy and not optimized, but it works (most of the time, anyway).

### Inspiration
This website is created with the api.met.no Localforecast API, this is the same API that is used for YR.no. The design is also largely inspired from the yr.no website.

### Updates
This repo/website will be updated in the future, when I find the time and motivation to go back and add features, optimize it and fix it.
